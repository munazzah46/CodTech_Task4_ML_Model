# CodTech Task 4 - Machine Learning Model Implementation

This repository contains the implementation of a **Spam Email Classifier** using Machine Learning (scikit-learn).

## Files Included

- `spam_classifier_model.pkl` – Trained ML model
- `vectorizer.pkl` – Fitted CountVectorizer for text processing
- `main.py` – Code to train, save and use the model
- `README.md` – This documentation

## Objective

To classify email messages as **spam** or **not spam** using a supervised learning approach (Multinomial Naive Bayes).

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository
2. Install required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run `main.py` to train or use the model
4. You can load `spam_classifier_model.pkl` and `vectorizer.pkl` to test with new emails
